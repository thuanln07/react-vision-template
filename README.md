Image Processing with Feature Matching Method
Introduction

Feature matching is a fundamental technique in image processing and computer vision, used to find and match key points between two or more images. It is widely applied in tasks such as:

    Object detection and tracking.
    Image stitching to create panoramas.
    3D reconstruction from multiple views.
    Object recognition and classification.

Key Steps in Feature Matching

    Feature Detection
    Identify key points in the image that are distinctive, such as corners, edges, or textured regions. Common algorithms:
        SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
        SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
        ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

    Feature Description
    Represent each key point with a descriptor, typically a vector, to facilitate comparison between images.

    Feature Matching
    Match key points between images based on the similarity of their descriptors. Common techniques:
        Brute-Force Matching: Compares all descriptors pairwise.
        FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors): Efficient approximate matching.

    Outlier Removal
    Use algorithms like RANSAC to filter out incorrect matches and refine the correspondence between images.
